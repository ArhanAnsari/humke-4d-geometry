# Useful Links

Here's a collection of some useful/inspiring links:

* [Miegakure](http://miegakure.com/) - truly four dimensional game. We're essentially trying to create a simplified version of this. The videos/explanations are a really good source of materials.
* [4D Visualization Document](http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/vis/vis) - this is a really interesting document with helpful animations and explanations about different ways to visualize and project 4D. Can be a good resource for the class as well. 
* [Tutorial on Parametric Equations](http://www.econym.demon.co.uk/isotut/parametric.htm) - is a good source for equations to try.
* [Rendering 3D parametric equations](http://www.jaanga.com/2014/07/algesurf-parametric-equations-math-in.html) - nice article with code samples and tools for rendering parametric equations. 
* [MathMod](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mathmod/?source=typ_redirect) - A program for visualizing and slicing 3D/4D objects?
* [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org/index.html) - Computational Geometry Algorithms Library for doing most of what we need to do. 
* [Rendering parametric surfaces](http://prideout.net/blog/?p=44) - Straightforward article on doing this in Python 
* [Lectures on computational geometry](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/754/Lects/754lects.pdf) - Includes stuff about convex hull algorithms.
