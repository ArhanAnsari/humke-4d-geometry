# Progress Report for April 13th 2017

To do:

* ~Make 2d intersections smooth with shaders~
* Finish 3D intersections 
  * ~Correctly calculate the intersection points~
  * ~Draw the filled in area of intersection in real time~
  * Make it work for X and Z planes too
  * Make it work for parametric and convex 
* ~Input 4D cartesian equation~
* ~See intersections in 4D volumes~
