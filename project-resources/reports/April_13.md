# Progress Report for April 13th 2017

To do:

* ~Make 2d intersections smooth with shaders~
* Finish 3D intersections 
  * ~Correctly calculate the intersection points~
  * ~Draw the filled in area of intersection in real time~
  * ~Make it work for X and Z planes too~
  * ~Make it work convex~
  * Make it work for parametric
  * Figure out clean way to fill the inside 
* ~Input 4D cartesian equation~
* ~See intersections in 4D volumes~
* Create a way to save and load the state

Next Steps:

* Input 4D convex hull
  * Figure out a way to calculate 3d intersections of this?
* Input 4D parametric 
  * I don't even know where to start here 
* Project 4D on the left side 
* What else are we missing?
