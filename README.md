# Humke 4D Geometry Viewer
A project for Professor Paul Humke at St. Olaf College. Developed with the Mathbox library (https://gitgud.io/unconed/mathbox), this project seeks to meet the goals outlined here:

## Basic Functionality
[ ] A Dimension is selected (2,3 or 4)

[ ] Objects can be assumed to be in a 10x10 bounding box, i.e. -10 < x < 10

## Inputing Objects
[ ] A cartesian equation

[ ] A convex hull of points

[ ] Parametrically

## Viewing Sections
[ ] The user specifies a coordinate direction (either x, y, or z) and a color

[ ] Sections orthogonal to the specified direction are shown via "slider" or "movie" beginning with -10 and ending with 10

[ ] Sections of 4D objects are 3D solidss so picturing and pulling around as per _Mathematica_ is desired
